                <h3>Weather Application (Python)</h3>
                <p>I developed a weather application featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily access real-time weather data. Utilizing a weather API, the application fetches current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant information based on user input. The intuitive design ensures a seamless user experience, making it simple for anyone to check the weather in their area or any location worldwide.</p>

                <h3>Home Automation System (IoT)</h3>
                <p>This project involved creating a home automation system using Arduino and various sensors. The system allows users to control home appliances remotely and automate tasks based on sensor data. For instance, the system can turn on lights when motion is detected or adjust the thermostat based on temperature readings. This project not only enhances convenience but also promotes energy efficiency in smart homes.</p>

                <h3>House Price Prediction (AI)</h3>
                <p>I developed a machine learning module to predict house prices using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project involved collecting and preprocessing a dataset of housing features and prices. The CNN model was trained to identify patterns and relationships within the data, enabling accurate predictions of house prices based on various input features. This project showcases my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, providing valuable insights for potential home buyers and real estate professionals.</p>
